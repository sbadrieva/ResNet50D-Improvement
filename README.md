# ResNet50D-Improvement
CNN Architecture ResNet-50D Improvements on imagenette

Accomplishments: 

• Improved existing ResNet-50D Deep Learning model for image classification by testing parameter changes and
various deep learning algorithms on a subset ImageNet dataset called imagenette
• Changes to architecture included adding a pooling layer, using Adagrad, RMSProp , and Adam optimizer, and
choosing the best activation function in conjunction to the best optimizer
• Raised accuracy of ResNet50D on imagenette from 83 percent to 89 percent and lowered loss from 16 percent to 11
percent
